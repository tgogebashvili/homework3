git checkout develop - switch to develop
git merge origin/develop_base - merge first branch
git push origin develop - push

git merge origin/develop_base2 - merge second branch
git push origin develop - it was rejected and needed fetch first
git fetch origin - I've fetched
git push origin develop - needed pull
git pull origin develop - received auto-merging conflict. I opened file update and save.

git add test.txt - added updated file
git status - just check
git commit -m "resolved conflict" - commit
git push origin develop - push successfully
